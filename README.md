# 🚀 AlgoGuide — Personalized Interview Preparation Platform

AlgoGuide is an adaptive interview preparation platform designed to replace static problem lists with a personalized, data-driven learning experience. The system analyzes user performance, tracks topic proficiency, and recommends relevant problems and learning resources to accelerate preparation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Backend Requirement**: This repository contains the **Frontend** code only. The full system architecture includes a Node.js/Express backend and a Python AI service. Ensure these services are running for full functionality.

## 📌 Motivation

Traditional interview preparation relies on fixed question sheets that do not adapt to individual strengths, weaknesses, or target roles. AlgoGuide was built to create a smarter preparation workflow that evolves with the learner by using performance analytics and AI-assisted recommendations.
